# jsBoard
An aircraft boarding simulator written in JavaScript

## Features/To-do

jsBoard currently supports these features:

* Presets for seat layouts of several popular narrowbody aircraft
* Simulate multiple boarding algorithms:
  * Back-to-front
  * Front-to-back
  * Random
  * Steffen 2008 [1]
  * Qiang 2014 [2] (Coming soon)
* Variable simulation speed
